# How to Architect a Personal Disaster Recovery Plan

* [Slide Deck from PASS Summit 2022](https://bobpusateri.blob.core.windows.net/shared/DemoData/PersonalDRPlan-PASS2022.pdf)


### Abstract
Being IT professionals working with data, we have long been accustomed to planning for disasters, designing our systems to be resilient and even rehearsing scenarios to ensure our teams are prepared to recover our environments. We do all of this to benefit our employers, but what happens when personal disaster strikes? How can we handle and rebound from adversity? Or what if we aren't here and our loved ones are left to pick up the pieces - will they be able to recover? Will they be able to get into our phone or email? This session is centered around ensuring our loved ones have the tools necessary to handle the ultimate disaster. Make no mistake, this session is about them, not you.
