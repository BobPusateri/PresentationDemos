# Recovering With Minimal Impact: Advanced Database Restore Methods

* [Demo Database](https://bobpusateri.blob.core.windows.net/shared/DemoData/DemoData.bak)


### Abstract
For mission-critical databases, backups are only half the battle â€“ restores are what really matter when disaster strikes. Standard restores, while effective, may require additional downtime and thus further impact your business. This session will explain and demonstrate three advanced restore methods you should know: point-in-time restores, piecemeal restores, and page restores. You will walk away with a solid understanding of these methods, when they are appropriate, and what can be done to ensure they are always possible. Attend this session and gain senior-level skills via extra knowledge of how to minimize downtime and user impact after disaster has struck!
