Big Data Clusters are a highly anticipated feature of SQL Server 2019, but what exactly are they? Attend this session to learn the basics of this hot new technology that adds HDFS and Spark to SQL Server. Topics covered will include SQL Server Big Data Cluster components and architecture and demonstrations of queries that combine relational and non-relational datasets. Attendees will leave with an understanding of how Big Data Clusters differ from a standard SQL Server deployment, the advantages and capabilities they offer, and which scenarios benefit most from their utilization.
