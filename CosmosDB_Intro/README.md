### Abstract
Azure Cosmos DB has quickly become a buzzword in database circles over the past few years, but what exactly is it, and why does it matter? This session will cover the basics of Azure Cosmos DB, how it works, and what it can do for your organization. You will learn how it differs from SQL Server and Azure SQL Database, what its strengths are, and how to leverage them. We will also discuss Azure Cosmos DB's partitioning, distribution, and consistency methods to gain an understanding of how they contribute to its unprecedented scalability. Finally we will demonstrate how to provision, connect to, and query Azure Cosmos DB. If you're wondering what Azure Cosmos DB is and why you should care, attend this session and learn why Azure Cosmos DB is an out-of-this-world tool you'll want in your data toolbox!
