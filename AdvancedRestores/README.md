### Abstract
We all know that backups are only half the battle â€“ restores are what really matter when disaster strikes. Standard restores, while effective, may require additional downtime and further affect the business. This session will demonstrate three advanced restore methods you should know: point-in-time restores, piecemeal restores, and page restores, and will discuss when each method is appropriate. Attend this session to learn how to be a better DBA by minimizing downtime and user impact after disaster has struck!
